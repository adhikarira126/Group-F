# Rachin Adhikari
For this project, I was responsible for creating and designing the Membership section, which was split into multiple pages, including Trophies and Constitution, as well as the Photos page. I focused on making these pages visually appealing and easy to navigate while keeping the design consistent with the rest of the site.

To achieve this, I spent time learning and experimenting with CSS to improve the layout, color scheme, and responsiveness of the pages. I made sure that the design was clean and uniform so that each page would fit well with the others. The Trophies page design, in particular, became a base style that was later adapted for other parts of the website, helping to create a cohesive look across the project.

Throughout the process, I collaborated with my teammates, meeting regularly in person and over Zoom to share progress and coordinate design elements. I also used GitHub for version control, resolving a few challenges related to image paths and commits not pushing correctly. Despite those small technical issues, the project went smoothly overall, and I am happy with how our website turned out.

Reflection:

To begin working on this project, we met as a group to decide which pages from 
https://fdlhorseproject.wixsite.com/home, the website for the Fond du Lac County 4-H 
Horse and Pony Project, each member would adapt. I chose to recreate the Home and 
Calendar pages from the original site.

The Home page was fairly easy and straightforward. Rachin had developed an 
aesthetically pleasing CSS segment for his trophies.html page, and I decided to adapt 
it to fit with the Home page and later, the Calendar page to make the site feel more 
uniform.

I relied a lot on the ZyBooks chapters about CSS for solving specific problems to 
achieve the desired look and format for each element on my pages. There were a few times, 
though, where I needed to perform outside research to learn how to format an element in a 
very particular way. I often needed to consult the internet to format the calendar I 
created in the exact way I had imagined it.

Over the course of the project assignment window, I worked on my pages and the site as 
a whole every few days. This was often before, during, and after we met as a group (in-person 
and online over Zoom).

Bugs:

The only potential bug that I am aware of is that images will sometimes not appear after 
the repository is pulled from GitHub. As a group, we were unable to intentionally reproduce 
this bug to find its cause. The images would appear correctly on one person's machine, but 
would appear as alt text on another person's machine. I am unsure of what was done to 
temporarily fix this, but I do know that it was / is a recurring issue.

We did also run into a potential bug with GitHub while working, in that a commit would 
sometimes not push to the repository on GitHub, even when the local machine believes the 
push was successful. We solved this by sharing the files over email when it was necessary 
to be copied and committed from someone else's machine. This should not affect the final 
website, it was simply an obstacle that we were able to overcome.
