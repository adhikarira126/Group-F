                                We are a 4-H club based in Fond du Lac, WI. Members of our club are able to grow their 
                                horsemanship skills through many of our club activities throughout the year, including 
                                parades, clinics, fairs, demonstrations, and educational activities. Club members are 
                                also able to connect with other youth involved in 4-H.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Along with many horse activities, we also have offered educational activities like 
                                horse bowl/hippology (which is basically competitive horse trivia), horse judging 
                                (which is where members learn how to place horses like a judge), and model horse 
                                (which is making scale models of different horse disciplines).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We hope to see you soon!
                            </p>
